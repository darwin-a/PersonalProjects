# Tableau Public Visualizations

## Background

In this section we go over some of the visualizations I've created by participating in **Makeover Monday** & **Workout Wednesday**. These
are both weekly challenges where participants construct compelling stories of data utilizing technologies such as Tableau, Power BI, etc...
I participated in these challenges to better understand how to communicate data to others

### [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/)

> **Makeover Monday** is your weekly learning and development appointment with yourself and hundreds of passionate data people. For free!
> Join us every Monday to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations and help us make information more accessible. The Makeover Monday community comes together every week from around the globe and we would love for YOU to become part of it, too.

### [Workout Wednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/)

> **Workout Wednesday** is a weekly challenge to re-create a data-driven visualization. The challenges are designed to grow participants knowledge of Tableau and help kick-start personal development. Each Wednesday a challenge is release and participants are asked to replicate the challenge that is posed as closely as possible.
